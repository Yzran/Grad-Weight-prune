# Grad-Weight-prune
This is a public project focusing on finging an universal and efficient way to prune deeplearning network.This project is absolutely open for anyone who want to join.I will try my best to enrich and update this project consistently.
There is a pretrained parameter file called resnet18_cifar10_0.5pruned.pth in this project.The best precision of raw Resnet18 is nearly 93% within 120 epoches,while pruned Resnet18s' is nearly 90% with the same trianed epoch.
